# Vidita Sports.com Data Analysis

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of PySpark to clean and analyze data from a CSV file related to Vidita Sports.com. The dataset includes customer information such as email, name, password hash, and address details. The goal of the project is to:

1. Load the data into a Spark DataFrame.
2. Clean and preprocess the address data.
3. Perform basic data aggregation and analysis.
4. Save the cleaned data to a new CSV file.

## Requirements

- Apache Spark (with PySpark)
- Python 3.x
- Pandas (optional, for further data manipulation)
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE

## Setup

1. Install **Apache Spark** on your local machine or use a cloud-based Spark platform.
2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pyspark pandas
   ```

## Steps

### Step 1: Importing Libraries

First, we import the necessary libraries for working with Spark.

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
```

### Step 2: Creating a SparkSession

We create a Spark session to interact with Spark.

```python
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("Vidita Sports.com").getOrCreate()
```

### Step 3: Reading the CSV File

We read the `sports.csv` file into a Spark DataFrame.

```python
df = spark.read.csv("sports.csv", header=True, inferSchema=True)
df.show()
```

This will display the raw content of the file.

### Step 4: Cleaning and Modifying the Address Fields

We clean the address-related fields to remove unnecessary spaces, rename columns for better clarity, and handle missing data.

```python
df_clean = df \
    .withColumn("city", df["_address_city"].alias("city").cast("string")) \
    .withColumn("country", df["_address_country_id"].alias("country_id").cast("string")) \
    .withColumn("street", df["_address_street"].alias("street").cast("string")) \
    .withColumn("telephone", df["_address_telephone"].alias("telephone").cast("string")) \
    .drop("_address_city", "_address_country_id", "_address_street", "_address_telephone")

df_clean = df_clean.dropna(subset=["city", "country", "street", "telephone"], how="any")
df_clean = df_clean.drop("city", "street")
df_clean.show(5)
```

### Step 5: Data Aggregation and Analysis

We can perform a simple data aggregation to count how many records exist for each country (based on the `country` column).

```python
df_country_count = df_clean.groupBy("country").count()
df_country_count.show()
```

### Step 6: Saving the Cleaned Data

Finally, we save the cleaned DataFrame to a new CSV file.

```python
df_clean.write.csv("vidita_sports_clean.csv", mode="overwrite", header=True)
```

## Output

- `sports.csv`: Original data file.
- `vidita_sports_clean.csv`: Cleaned and modified data file.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the complete process of loading, cleaning, analyzing, and saving data using PySpark. The cleaned data can be further analyzed or integrated into machine learning models for deeper insights.
